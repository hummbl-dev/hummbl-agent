# TODO

## Immediate
- Add Base120 skills to registry (manual/prompt-only, no execution)
- Add router sample cases and text-only tests
- Validate CI pass on latest changes

## Near-term
- Capability-aware routing integration test cases
- Evidence lint adoption for any canonical evidence logs
- Experiment mode: run first controlled experiment cycle

## Later
- Optional vendor API adapters with explicit network policy and approvals
- Observation importer integration with evidence hashes in SITREPs
