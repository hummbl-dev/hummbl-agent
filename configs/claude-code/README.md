# Claude Code Configuration (Template)

These settings are intended as a starter template for integrating HUMMBL agents and continuous learning hooks with Claude Code.

## Apply

```bash
cp /Users/others/hummbl-agent/configs/claude-code/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json
```

## Notes

- Update paths if your Claude Code installation uses a different home directory.
- Hooks reference the continuous-learning-v2 skill hook scripts if installed.
